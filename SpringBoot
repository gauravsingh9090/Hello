Spring Boot is an open-source framework that simplifies the development of Java-based applications, particularly those using the Spring framework. It provides a set of conventions and defaults that allow developers to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications with minimal configuration.

Key Features of Spring Boot:
Auto-Configuration: Spring Boot can automatically configure components based on the dependencies present in the project. For example, if you have a database dependency in your project, Spring Boot will automatically configure a DataSource bean.

Standalone Applications: Spring Boot allows you to create standalone applications that can be run with java -jar or more traditional methods. It eliminates the need to deploy WAR files to an external server by embedding a server like Tomcat or Jetty directly in the application.

Spring Initializr: Spring Boot provides a tool called Spring Initializr, which helps you quickly generate a new Spring Boot project with the necessary dependencies.

Production-Ready Features: Spring Boot comes with many built-in features that are important for production applications, such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration.

Command-Line Interface (CLI): Spring Boot provides a CLI that allows you to run and test Spring Boot applications from the command line.

Spring Boot Starters: These are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application. They simplify dependency management by bundling commonly used dependencies for specific tasks, like spring-boot-starter-web for web applications.

Getting Started with Spring Boot:
To create a simple Spring Boot application, follow these steps:

Create a Spring Boot Project:

You can use the Spring Initializr (available online or through IDEs) to generate a project with the required dependencies.
Select the necessary dependencies like Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, etc.
Write the Main Application Class:

Spring Boot applications typically have a main class annotated with @SpringBootApplication. This annotation triggers auto-configuration, component scanning, and other features.
