Java Swing is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) used to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for Java applications. It provides a set of 'lightweight' (all-Java language) components that, to the maximum degree possible, work the same on all platforms.

Key Features of Java Swing:
Platform Independence: Swing components are written entirely in Java and thus are platform-independent. They run the same on any operating system that supports Java.
Lightweight Components: Unlike the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) components, Swing components are lightweight, meaning they are not reliant on native GUI controls.
Pluggable Look and Feel: Swing supports a pluggable look and feel. You can change the appearance of the GUI components to match the platform's native look, or use a completely different look.
MVC Architecture: Swing is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the internal representation of information from the way it is presented to the user.
Rich Set of Components: Swing provides a richer set of GUI components than AWT, such as trees, tables, lists, tabbed panels, and more.
